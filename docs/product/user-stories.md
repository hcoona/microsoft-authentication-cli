# Product User Stories

This record owns user context and motivation for requirements work. It does not define
normative behavior, realization choices, validation procedures, or current support.
Those concerns belong to [requirements](requirements/),
[architecture](../architecture/overview.md), [validation](../validation/strategy.md), and
[research](../research/v1-public-contract-baseline.md).

## Primary Journey: Personal Azure DevOps Git Access

> As a developer working with a personal Azure DevOps Git repository while my Windows WAM
> default account is a corporate work account, I want the Git credential adapter to
> request an Azure DevOps access token from the AzureAuth Unofficial V2 authentication
> engine for the personal Microsoft account email selected for that repository, so that
> Git operations do not silently authenticate as the corporate account and can reuse valid
> authentication state without prompting when it is available.

The developer has selected a personal account for this repository, not whichever account
happens to be the operating-system default. Repeated Git operations make wrong-account
success and unnecessary prompts particularly disruptive.

The external adapter identifies Azure DevOps, selects a Client Profile, and supplies the
account email and Azure DevOps scope as consumer knowledge. Repository bindings, remote
parsing, Git credential protocol, and any PAT lifecycle remain outside the authentication
engine under [decision 0004](../decisions/0004-keep-the-authentication-engine-separate-from-consumers.md).

This is the primary first-release blocking journey. Its acceptance evidence belongs to
the [primary-journey validation gate](../validation/strategy.md#primary-journey-gate).
The WAM context explains the wrong-default risk; it does not select WAM as the required
implementation or establish that any Client Profile or platform supports this journey.

### Account-Context Variants

The same requested-account goal applies across company-account and non-company-account
computer contexts, each with a requested company or personal account. These four
combinations are scenario variants, not four independent stories or additional
first-release commitments. The computer's default account, existing target-account
sign-in, and device management, join, or compliance are separate context; account labels
do not establish device state.

## Reuse Existing Operating-System Sign-In on First Use

> As a developer already signed in to my selected account through the operating system,
> I want the authentication engine to reuse that sign-in when compatible state is
> available on its first use, so that adopting the engine does not require an unnecessary
> separate sign-in.

This goal does not depend on an earlier engine invocation. OS sign-in alone does not
establish safely identifiable target-account state, resource authorization, or a suitable
Client Profile. The goal does not bypass interactive service policy or permit use of an
opaque OS default. Provider-account visibility and actual reuse remain evidence-gated.

## Reuse Authentication Across Package Ecosystems and Repositories

> As a developer using Azure Artifacts from multiple package ecosystems and repositories,
> I want compatible requests to reuse available valid authentication results for my
> selected account, so that moving between those tools and repositories does not cause
> redundant sign-in for the same authorized access.

The engine's contribution is safe authentication-state and access-token reuse. Package
configuration, ecosystem-specific credential translation, and derived-credential
lifecycle stay with downstream adapters. The goal does not require identical token bytes,
sharing across incompatible authorization or security contexts, or a single prompt
across concurrent processes.

## Background Requests Without Unexpected UI

> As a developer whose tools request authentication in the background, I want those
> requests to run without unexpected authentication or state-unlock UI, so that background
> work does not interrupt me or wait for a prompt I cannot attend.

A caller can prohibit interaction even when sign-in or unlocking state would be needed.
This goal is control over interaction, not guaranteed background success.

## Direct Protected-Service Access

> As a developer calling a protected development or test service, I want to obtain an
> access token for the intended resource using my authorized user identity, so that I
> can make permitted calls from local tools or scripts without implementing a separate
> sign-in flow in each caller.

User identity means delegated end-user identity, not a general promise of personal
Microsoft-account support. The caller supplies its explicit authentication intent;
service calls and use of the returned access token remain caller responsibilities.

## Authentication Integrated Into a Remote-Tool Workflow

> As a user of a tool client, I want its authentication integration to acquire and reuse
> credentials for the intended remote service under my selected user identity, so that I
> can use authorized remote capabilities without manually obtaining or copying access
> tokens.

MCP is an illustrative consumer protocol, not a protocol handled by the engine or a
selected proxy, interception, or injection mechanism. The integration calls the engine
for delegated authentication; connections and service-specific credential application
remain downstream. This goal makes no claim about a particular implementation.

## Upgrade the Engine Without Changing a Compatible Adapter

> As an adapter maintainer, I want users to upgrade the authentication engine without
> changing my adapter while its protocol major remains supported, so that authentication
> improvements do not force unrelated integration changes.

Protocol majors are distinct from the V2 product-generation name. This goal is not
indefinite support for old protocols or compatibility with official AzureAuth.

## Requirements and Validation Routes

These routes identify the behavioral and evidence authorities; they are not a second
set of acceptance criteria. Additional stories do not select profiles, mechanisms,
platforms, or new first-release scenario commitments. The primary journey remains the
first-release blocker.
