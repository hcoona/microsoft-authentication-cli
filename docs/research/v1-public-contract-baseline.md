# AzureAuth V1 Public Contract Baseline

## Purpose and authority

This record is the public-source research authority for the caller-visible AzureAuth V1
baseline used by [Issue #25](https://github.com/hcoona/microsoft-authentication-cli/issues/25).
It preserves material promises, source behavior, defects, inferences, and unresolved
limits without converting V1 behavior into a V2 compatibility, support, architecture, or
release commitment.

The original research was authorized by `main-v2` commit
[`d09d357c3fee953740d4a7470f57c57da56bbf5d`](https://github.com/hcoona/microsoft-authentication-cli/commit/d09d357c3fee953740d4a7470f57c57da56bbf5d).
Its accepted
[Delivery Wave](https://github.com/hcoona/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/d09d357c3fee953740d4a7470f57c57da56bbf5d/docs/delivery-wave.md#L18-L79)
authorized fixed-scope V1 research, the three fired public-source rechecks, and
reconciliation of the canonical V2 requirements.

The initial [Issue #29](https://github.com/hcoona/microsoft-authentication-cli/issues/29)
consumer reconciliation and `RECHECK-006` incorporation used the accepted
[story-grounded Wave at `1a02498`](https://github.com/hcoona/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/1a02498589769c38bc16eefc2efc5f9eca6e6994/docs/delivery-wave.md).
Subsequent story and reuse refinement uses the accepted
[product-bounded Wave at `c281406`](https://github.com/hcoona/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/c281406feb4141b2b0f75d43c3a0ca26d449c37b/docs/delivery-wave.md).
These changes amend current requirement dispositions, not the pinned V1 source findings.

This record is evidence rather than product policy:

- required product behavior remains owned by the
  [V2 requirements](../product/requirements/);
- compatibility remains owned by the
  [compatibility and migration policy](../product/compatibility-and-migration.md);
- architecture selection remains owned by architecture and decision records; and
- evidence required before claiming support remains owned by the
  [validation strategy](../validation/strategy.md).

## Evidence boundary

### Fixed V1 source scope

The immutable V1 inputs are:

- audited upstream commit
  [`de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918`](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/commit/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918);
- tag
  [`0.9.5`](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/tree/21258ff3a2cbb01d6891243114a55abe9ae3587e),
  commit `21258ff3a2cbb01d6891243114a55abe9ae3587e`;
- tag
  [`0.9.6`](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/tree/8ef1b8b00782bf20a51de078289819a79c3cba70),
  commit `8ef1b8b00782bf20a51de078289819a79c3cba70`;
- their public README, usage documentation, changelog, support material, command
  definitions, implementation, tests, installers, and release definitions; and
- the accepted V2 product, compatibility, architecture, validation, research, and
  governance records.

Fixed-source tests are source corroboration only. Mocked account, broker, cache, browser,
device-code, IWA, and platform tests do not establish real service or operating-system
behavior.

### Fired current-source scope

Current mutable evidence is limited to the sources named by the accepted
[recheck registry](rechecks.yaml):

- [`RECHECK-001`: AzureAuth issue #464](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/issues/464);
- [`RECHECK-002`: AzureAuth issue #465](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/issues/465); and
- [`RECHECK-007`: Microsoft Learn Azure DevOps Entra OAuth guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/integrate/get-started/authentication/entra-oauth?view=azure-devops).

The recheck evaluation occurred on **2026-09-04 UTC**. At retrieval:

- issue #464 was open, unanswered, and had zero comments;
- issue #465 was open, unanswered, and had zero comments; and
- the Microsoft Learn page returned revision
  `f7bd73fbf08aed577f62dceb04fa31aa16643c19`, with
  `Last-Modified: 2026-05-08T17:05:00Z`.

These mutable facts are bounded to that evaluation time.

The later `RECHECK-006` retrieved only
[upstream issue #398](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/issues/398)
and its public comments on **2026-09-09 UTC**. Its
[dated outcome](#recheck-006-secure-store-availability) is a separate evaluation of that
source, not a refresh of the three sources above.

### Exclusions

There are no new runtime observations in this record. It makes no claim based on
executing AzureAuth, MSAL, broker, browser, device code, IWA, cache, installers,
migration, restore, build, tests, packaging, telemetry, or account access.

This record does not:

- freeze a V2 request, result, process, or wire contract;
- select an implementation Slice, platform matrix, mechanism, cache technology, or
  telemetry backend;
- implement or import upstream code;
- authorize a compatibility adapter, package, release, or experiment;
- claim current platform or account support; or
- expand the authentication core into PAT lifecycle, Git credential protocols, host
  adapters, confidential clients, service principals, managed identities, or workload
  identities.

## Evidence categories

Material statements are classified as:

- **Explicit public promise:** caller-facing documentation, command help, changelog,
  release, or support language.
- **Source finding:** behavior directly recoverable from the authorized source.
- **Inference:** a bounded interpretation needed to explain source composition, without
  treating intent as an enforced promise.
- **Known defect or workaround:** a contradiction, unsafe widening, lossy boundary, or
  source path that does not enforce its stated intent.
- **Unresolved empirical question:** behavior that authorized desk evidence cannot
  establish.
- **Publicly reported observation:** a public reporter's account, not an independently
  reproduced runtime result.

Confidence is high for direct fixed-source findings and documented public text.
Confidence in real provider, broker, host, secure-store, installer, or network effects is
not inferred from those materials.

V1 is an existing engineering baseline, not a hypothetical implementation. Its released
integrations, documented dependency contracts, and applicable public experience can
support architecture decisions without a new local reproduction. A public runtime report
retains its actual scenario and provenance; it need not be relabeled as our experiment
to be useful. Neither adoption alone nor an unspecified successful login establishes a
different account, resource, host, or V2 postcondition. Investigate the material difference
from an established path rather than reopening the feasibility of its entire mechanism.

## Executive conclusion

AzureAuth V1 publicly presents a cross-platform command-line wrapper around MSAL for
delegated public-client token acquisition and recommends subprocess integration as a
credential-provider boundary. Its caller surface includes:

- generic `aad` acquisition;
- Azure DevOps token and PAT commands;
- command-line, alias, and environment inputs;
- cache persistence and clearing;
- multiple acquisition mechanisms;
- raw-token, status, and JSON output;
- diagnostics and telemetry configuration;
- platform-specific installers and packages; and
- upstream support and operational identities.

The fixed source contains useful mechanism integrations and platform knowledge, but does
not define the deterministic machine contract required by V2:

- domain-based account selection is advisory rather than strict;
- caller acquisition order is discarded;
- broker silent and interactive work are combined;
- no-interaction policy is ambient and not independently enforced;
- fallback is driven by broad failure rather than typed retryability;
- claims retry loses the selected account;
- lock waiting, acquisition timeout, and cancellation do not form one lifecycle;
- authoritative provider result metadata is discarded;
- access-token claims are used to reconstruct identity;
- output and failures are unversioned and lossy;
- secure-cache failure may silently select plaintext or process-local state; and
- upstream telemetry, build dependencies, installation identities, and Azure DevOps PAT
  behavior cannot be inherited by the unofficial V2 product.

`RECHECK-001` and `RECHECK-002` confirm that the 2026-09-04 upstream public evidence does not
weaken the accepted V2 interaction or account requirements. `RECHECK-007` records current
guidance but does not satisfy the prerequisite for selecting or distributing the
Microsoft-owned Azure DevOps profile.

## Architecture Reuse and Remaining Deltas

This desk assessment uses the fixed V1 source above and MSAL.NET **4.83.1**, commit
[`d5d7de6b103f0d9dd7bca9bf13cbb9f3da37bc9f`](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/tree/d5d7de6b103f0d9dd7bca9bf13cbb9f3da37bc9f),
retrieved on **2026-09-10 UTC**. That is the managed MSAL and MSAL Extensions version
referenced by AzureAuth
[`0.9.6`](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/8ef1b8b00782bf20a51de078289819a79c3cba70/src/MSALWrapper/MSALWrapper.csproj#L29-L35).
It is a comparison baseline, not a selected V2 dependency pin. No authentication,
cache, build, or platform experiment was performed for this assessment.

### Existing Mechanism and Result Contracts

**Source findings:** V1's
[`PCAWrapper`](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/src/MSALWrapper/PCAWrapper.cs#L81-L180)
already calls MSAL account enumeration, selected-account silent acquisition, interactive
acquisition, and device-code acquisition. The dependency's
[`IClientApplicationBase`](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/blob/d5d7de6b103f0d9dd7bca9bf13cbb9f3da37bc9f/src/client/Microsoft.Identity.Client/IClientApplicationBase.cs#L37-L74)
defines application-cache account enumeration and account-scoped silent acquisition,
including `MsalUiRequiredException` when interaction is needed. These operations do not
need to be invented or experimentally rediscovered to allocate V2 responsibilities.

MSAL's
[`AuthenticationResult`](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/blob/d5d7de6b103f0d9dd7bca9bf13cbb9f3da37bc9f/src/client/Microsoft.Identity.Client/AuthenticationResult.cs#L257-L331)
exposes the access token, expiry, account, token tenant, and granted scopes. V1's
[`TokenResultOrNull`](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/src/MSALWrapper/PCAWrapper.cs#L209-L216)
reduces that result to a parsed access token and correlation ID. Preserving the provider
result at the V2 adapter boundary therefore remedies an application-layer information
loss; absence of a metadata API is not an open feasibility question.

The narrower limit is meaningful:
[`IAccount.Username`](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/blob/d5d7de6b103f0d9dd7bca9bf13cbb9f3da37bc9f/src/client/Microsoft.Identity.Client/IAccount.cs#L17-L22)
is documented as a displayable UPN-format value that can be null. `AuthenticationResult`
also documents missing account elements and tenant information. Those contracts alone do
not guarantee that every profile returns the requested full email, exposes every OS
account on first use, or represents aliases identically. Keep exact matching and missing
metadata handling in V2; do not infer aliases or parse the access token to fill gaps.

### Persistence Completion and Observability

**Source findings:** In the pinned managed request path,
[`RequestBase`](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/blob/d5d7de6b103f0d9dd7bca9bf13cbb9f3da37bc9f/src/client/Microsoft.Identity.Client/Internal/Requests/RequestBase.cs#L322-L362)
awaits cache processing before constructing the authentication result. The
[`token cache`](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/blob/d5d7de6b103f0d9dd7bca9bf13cbb9f3da37bc9f/src/client/Microsoft.Identity.Client/TokenCache.ITokenCacheInternal.cs#L250-L282)
awaits the after-access callback. MSAL Extensions
[`registers`](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/blob/d5d7de6b103f0d9dd7bca9bf13cbb9f3da37bc9f/src/client/Microsoft.Identity.Client.Extensions.Msal/MsalCacheHelper.cs#L306-L318)
its persistence callback, whose
[`write path`](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/blob/d5d7de6b103f0d9dd7bca9bf13cbb9f3da37bc9f/src/client/Microsoft.Identity.Client.Extensions.Msal/MsalCacheHelper.cs#L443-L488)
catches and logs a storage-write exception, then releases its lock.

**Architecture inference:** Treating every provider task as returning before persistence,
or equating successful task completion with confirmed durable storage, would both be
incorrect assumptions about this path. V2 can retain the existing secure-store
integration knowledge, but needs an explicit persistence-status boundary. The remaining
question is which supported integration reports completion or failure while respecting
the request lifetime and `V2-REQ-041`. This finding does not generalize the managed path
to broker-owned storage or justify an added background persistence service.

### Decision Impact

| Concern | Existing basis to reuse | V2 difference and smallest remaining investigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Account discovery and silent acquisition | Real `IAccount` enumeration and account-scoped MSAL calls already exist. | Check first-use OS-account visibility and whether the selected profile supplies the exact email needed by the primary journey; ordinary cached-account matching is application logic. |
| Result identity | MSAL exposes account, token tenant, scopes, and expiry. | Preserve those fields and enforce the accepted postconditions; inspect profile-specific missing or alias metadata only where it affects the journey. |
| Interaction | V1 integrates broker, browser, and device code; MSAL separates silent and interactive APIs. | Replace V1's combined fallback policy. Host-owned completion and cancellation need evidence for the concrete host choice, not a new proof that OAuth interaction exists. |
| Secure reuse | V1 configures MSAL Extensions and platform stores. | Remove plaintext fallback and upstream namespaces; determine completion/status reporting and compatible V2 reuse. Rely on platform protection contracts within the workstation threat model. |
| Personal-account Azure DevOps access | V1 supplies the Visual Studio client ID and Azure DevOps scope through existing acquisition paths. | Obtain evidence for the specific MSA/resource/registration combination under RECHECK-007; general V1 adoption does not identify that combination. |

Use this delta assessment when accepting high-level responsibilities. It does not require
every integration or future release scenario to be demonstrated before the architecture
can be useful. Only an unresolved difference that could invalidate a particular choice
keeps that choice open. The [validation strategy](../validation/strategy.md) separately
governs evidence before implementation behavior or platform support is claimed.

## Caller-visible V1 surface

This inventory establishes coverage of Issue #25 without creating a universal
traceability database.

### Commands

The fixed command hierarchy is:

- `azureauth`, a help-only root;
- `azureauth aad`, generic delegated public-client acquisition and cache clearing;
- `azureauth ado`, a help-only grouping command;
- `azureauth ado token`, Azure DevOps token or PAT selection and formatting;
- `azureauth ado pat`, PAT creation, caching, and reuse;
- `azureauth ado pat scopes`, static PAT-scope listing;
- `azureauth info`, assembly version and upstream telemetry device ID; and
- `azureauth info reset-device-id`, upstream telemetry-identifier reset.

The root and grouping behavior is established by the
[root command](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/src/AzureAuth/Commands/CommandAzureAuth.cs#L15-L27)
and
[`ado` command](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/src/AzureAuth/Commands/CommandAdo.cs#L11-L24).

### Generic `aad` inputs

The declared options are:

- `--resource`;
- `--client`;
- `--tenant`;
- `--prompt-hint`;
- repeatable `--scope`;
- `--clear`;
- `--domain`;
- repeatable `--mode`;
- `--output`;
- `--alias`;
- `--config`; and
- `--timeout`.

Their declarations are recoverable from
[`CommandAad`](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/src/AzureAuth/Commands/CommandAad.cs#L146-L217).

The complete rendered help, inherited framework options, parser diagnostics, and ordinary
process-exit propagation are not fully recoverable because hosting is partly owned by the
unavailable `Microsoft.Office.Lasso` dependency.

### Ambient inputs

Material environment-controlled behavior includes:

- `AZUREAUTH_CONFIG`;
- `AZUREAUTH_MODE`;
- `AZUREAUTH_NO_USER`;
- `Corext_NonInteractive`;
- `OEAUTH_MSAL_DISABLE_CACHE`;
- `BROWSER`;
- `AZUREAUTH_ADO_PAT`;
- `SYSTEM_ACCESSTOKEN`;
- `TF_BUILD`;
- `AZUREAUTH_APPLICATION_INSIGHTS_INGESTION_TOKEN`;
- installer-specific `AZUREAUTH_*` settings; and
- environment names supplied to upstream telemetry.

These names and their V1 precedence are compatibility facts, not native V2 defaults.

### Output and process surface

V1 exposes:

- AAD `status`, `token`, `json`, and `none` output modes;
- PAT `none`, `status`, `token`, `base64`, `header`, `headervalue`, and `json` modes;
- predominantly `0` and `1` command-handler results;
- a hard-coded SIGINT exit of `2`;
- intended separation of token stdout from warning/error diagnostics; and
- framework-owned parser, logging, and process-exit behavior that is not completely
  visible in the fixed repository.

## Product, command, and compatibility findings

### Delegated public-client and subprocess boundary

**Evidence type:** Explicit public promise.
**Confidence:** 10/10 for the documented V1 purpose.

V1 promises delegated public-client access-token acquisition and recommends invoking the
CLI as a subprocess to isolate callers from authentication-library dependencies and
change.
[README](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/README.md#L10-L24),
[usage](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/docs/usage.md#L102-L129).

**Disposition:** Delegated public-client authentication is retained by `V2-REQ-001`.
`V2-REQ-004` now defines one machine request and one terminal outcome per native
authentication process. Subprocess isolation does not require V1 command or wire
compatibility.

### Command hierarchy and stale integration example

**Evidence type:** Source finding plus known defect/workaround.
**Confidence:** 10/10.

The root command became help-only before the audited baseline, but the published Python
example still invokes authentication options at the root.
[example](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/examples/python/azureauth.py#L7-L28),
[changelog](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/CHANGELOG.md#L93-L102).

The fixed-source workaround is to insert `aad` after the executable. No execution is
needed to establish the source contradiction.

**Disposition:** V1 command names and hierarchy are compatibility-only. Do not copy the
stale invocation into native V2 documentation. A compatibility adapter would need to
satisfy the compatibility-adapter gate before acceptance.

### Platform and mechanism promises

**Evidence type:** Explicit public promise.
**Confidence:** 10/10 for documentation; no runtime confidence is inferred.

V1 claims Windows, macOS, and Ubuntu support and documents cache, IWA, broker, browser,
and device-code combinations.
[README](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/README.md#L14-L24).

**Disposition:** These promises are inputs to the
[Real Environment Tests](../validation/strategy.md#real-environment-tests) and platform
evidence in the validation strategy. They do not establish that V2 supports the same
combinations or that every V1 matrix cell works.

## Request, authority, profile, and precedence findings

### Request fields and precedence

**Evidence type:** Source finding with test corroboration.
**Confidence:** 10/10.

The generic request surface carries client, tenant, scopes derived from either resource
or explicit scopes, optional preferred domain, prompt hint, mode flags, timeout, output
preference, and alias values. It has no explicit authority-host, tenant-policy, stable
account constraint, interaction policy, host context, or ordered acquisition-stage
field.

Explicit command values override non-null alias values. Explicit command modes override
`AZUREAUTH_MODE`, which otherwise supplies comma-separated ambient defaults.
[alias merge](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/src/AzureAuth/Alias.cs#L43-L63),
[environment parsing](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/src/AzureAuth/IEnvExtensions.cs#L42-L71).

**Disposition:** `V2-REQ-010`, `V2-REQ-011`, `V2-REQ-017`, and `V2-REQ-018` own the
explicit versioned CLI request, request scopes, intent precedence, and mandatory Client
Profile selection. V1 aliases, ambient defaults, option names, and TOML structure are not
native V2 request semantics.

### Resource and scope contradiction

**Evidence type:** Explicit public promise plus known defect/workaround.
**Confidence:** 10/10.

Usage says client, resource, and tenant are always required. The implementation instead
requires client, tenant, and either resource or one or more scopes. Resource is converted
to `<resource>/.default`; explicit scopes supersede resource with a warning.
[usage](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/docs/usage.md#L64-L70),
[source](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/src/AzureAuth/Commands/CommandAad.cs#L293-L304).

**Disposition:** `V2-REQ-011` excludes a separate resource input and profile scope
presets. `V2-REQ-027` owns dynamic permission coverage and the distinct `/.default`
request/result association. V1 resource shorthand and precedence are not inherited.

### Client, tenant, and authority validation

**Evidence type:** Source finding.
**Confidence:** 10/10 for source shape; real MSAL authority handling is not inferred.

The CLI checks the client and tenant for nonemptiness. Client conversion to `Guid` occurs
later. Tenant remains a string appended beneath fixed host
`https://login.microsoftonline.com/`; the CLI does not expose an arbitrary authority
host.
[request object](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/src/MSALWrapper/AuthParameters.cs#L12-L47),
[authority construction](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/src/MSALWrapper/AuthFlow/Web.cs#L97-L112).

**Disposition:** `V2-REQ-011`, `V2-REQ-011A`, and `V2-REQ-019` own one-cloud profiles,
trusted authority validation, and fixed/common/exact token-tenant policy. Invalid inputs
follow `V2-REQ-032`; the V1 string-concatenation behavior does not define that policy.

### Built-in Azure DevOps profile

**Evidence type:** Source finding.
**Confidence:** 10/10 for identifiers and command wiring; no account-support confidence
is inferred.

The V1 Azure DevOps path embeds:

- client `872cd9fa-d31f-45e0-9eab-6e460a02d1f1`, described as "Visual Studio 2019 and
  earlier";
- Azure DevOps scope `499b84ac-1321-427f-aa17-267ca6975798/.default`;
- a Microsoft tenant default; and
- preferred domain `microsoft.com`.

[constants](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/src/AzureAuth/Ado/Constants.cs#L13-L60),
[profile construction](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/src/AzureAuth/Ado/AuthParameters.cs#L7-L18).

**Disposition:** The identifiers are nonsecret configuration and recoverable V1
compatibility evidence. They map to `V2-REQ-042` and the externally owned client-profile
gate. They do not establish current owner-approved reuse, account-type support, or
availability. `V2-REQ-018` requires explicit profile selection but does not make this
candidate an available profile. The V1 resource-specific bundle is not the V2 Client
Profile model.

## Account and interaction findings

### Account selection is advisory

**Evidence type:** Explicit public promise, source finding, and known defect.
**Confidence:** 10/10 for the source contract.

`--domain` is explicitly described as a preferred cached-account filter. Source matching
uses a case-insensitive username suffix rather than a provider-native stable identifier.
No account, no matching account, and multiple matching accounts collapse to `null`.
[help](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/src/AzureAuth/Commands/CommandAad.cs#L72-L80),
[lookup](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/src/MSALWrapper/PCAWrapper.cs#L150-L180).

On Windows broker paths, that `null` becomes
`PublicClientApplication.OperatingSystemAccount`, widening absence or ambiguity to
OS-account acquisition.
[broker resolution](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/src/MSALWrapper/AuthFlow/Broker.cs#L119-L142).

Device-code and IWA paths do not enforce a returned-identity match against the preferred
domain.

**Disposition:** Replace advisory account selection under the reconciled requirements:

- `V2-REQ-012`, requiring a strict full email rather than stable-ID or Account Kind input;
- `V2-REQ-017`, preserving caller intent;
- `V2-REQ-020`, unique real-account resolution before silent acquisition;
- `V2-REQ-013`, mandatory selected-account silent-first ordering;
- `V2-REQ-022`, terminal email, tenant, profile, and scope postconditions;
- `V2-REQ-023`, terminal mismatch or unvalidated success; and
- `V2-REQ-031` and `V2-REQ-032`, provider-observed email metadata and typed
  interaction-required, ambiguity, and identity-validation failure.

The V1 nullable selector, domain-suffix matching, and OS-account widening must not be
reused as V2 policy.

### Acquisition modes discard caller order

**Evidence type:** Source finding and known defect.
**Confidence:** 10/10.

`AuthMode` is a flag set. Repeated modes are combined using bitwise OR, discarding
textual order. The factory imposes cache, IWA, broker, web, and device-code ordering and
may inject cache even when the caller selected a different mechanism.
[mode combination](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/src/MSALWrapper/AuthMode.cs#L124-L133),
[factory](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/src/MSALWrapper/AuthFlow/AuthFlowFactory.cs#L38-L87).

**Disposition:** `V2-REQ-013` owns documented product acquisition order, compatible
mechanism filtering, and mandatory silent-first behavior after unique account resolution.
V1's discarded order is a source fact, not a reason to expose caller ordering or profile
order defaults in V2.

### Broker combines silent and interactive policy

**Evidence type:** Source finding plus bounded inference.
**Confidence:** 10/10 for sequencing.

Broker resolves an account, attempts silent acquisition, and proceeds to interactive
broker acquisition after a miss. One reported broker attempt therefore contains two
policy-distinct stages.
[broker](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/src/MSALWrapper/AuthFlow/Broker.cs#L78-L116).

The bounded inference is that V1 was optimized for broad human-oriented fallback rather
than exact caller-controlled stage policy.

**Disposition:** Retain `V2-REQ-014`, `V2-REQ-020`, and `V2-REQ-021`. Mechanism-level
calls may be adapted behind separate V2 silent and interactive stages; the composite V1
policy contract must not be reused.

### No-interaction policy is not independent

**Evidence type:** Explicit public promise, source finding, known defect, and completed
`RECHECK-001`.
**Confidence:** 10/10 for the source and current named-source disposition; no UI
occurrence is claimed.

V1 derives noninteractive behavior from `AZUREAUTH_NO_USER` or
`Corext_NonInteractive`, not from a per-request interaction-policy field. On Windows the
filter replaces requested modes with IWA rather than preserving broker-backed silent
acquisition. On non-Windows builds the broker flag can survive, while the composite
broker source can proceed from a silent miss to the interactive operation.
[environment control](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/src/AzureAuth/IEnvExtensions.cs#L31-L40),
[filter](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/src/AzureAuth/AuthModeExtensions.cs#L15-L42).

At the 2026-09-04 recheck,
[upstream issue #464](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/issues/464)
remained an open, unanswered request for independent interaction permission and a
machine-distinguishable interaction-required result. The authorized source set contained
no current documented upstream contract that preserves silent-capable mechanisms while
guaranteeing no UI.

**Disposition:** `RECHECK-001` is completed with no weakening. Retain:

- `V2-REQ-014`, independent interaction permission;
- `V2-REQ-013` and `V2-REQ-020`, silent-first order and its account precondition;
- `V2-REQ-021`, an absolute no-user-interface guarantee;
- `V2-REQ-023`, typed retryable and terminal fallback; and
- the interaction-required category in `V2-REQ-032`.

Do not reuse the global environment filter or combined broker orchestration as the V2
interaction contract.

### Fallback lacks typed retryability

**Evidence type:** Source finding and known defect.
**Confidence:** 10/10.

The executor advances after any attempt without a token rather than after an outcome
explicitly classified as retryable. A small set of exceptions is captured, other
exceptions may escape, and broker unavailability is represented by omission or
fall-through. A non-null token stops the chain even when prior errors exist.
[flow base](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/src/MSALWrapper/AuthFlow/AuthFlowBase.cs#L19-L55),
[executor](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/src/MSALWrapper/AuthFlow/AuthFlowExecutor.cs#L57-L87).

**Disposition:** Retain `V2-REQ-023` and `V2-REQ-032`. Replace exception-driven
fall-through with stable caller-action classifications. Cancellation, denial, identity
mismatch, and failure to validate reported success remain terminal.

### Claims retry loses account continuity

**Evidence type:** Source finding and known defect.
**Confidence:** 10/10.

Web and broker retry after `MsalUiRequiredException` without requiring a semantically
classified claims challenge. The claims overload constructs a new interactive request
with scopes and claims but does not preserve the selected account.
[web retry](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/src/MSALWrapper/AuthFlow/Web.cs#L55-L78),
[claims overload](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/src/MSALWrapper/PCAWrapper.cs#L86-L135).

**Disposition:** `V2-REQ-015`, `V2-REQ-022`, and `V2-REQ-024` own request-local provider
claims handling and preservation of every original constraint. This does not authorize
a public resource/CAE continuation protocol or `cp1` advertisement.

### Deadline, cancellation, and locking are separate lifecycles

**Evidence type:** Explicit public promise, source finding, inference, and known defect.
**Confidence:** 10/10 for timer and lock topology; no real prompt-cleanup behavior is
inferred.

The public timeout is described as an allowed-runtime contract, but acquisition first
waits under a separate fixed 15-minute named mutex. The requested timeout starts after
that wait.
[usage](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/docs/usage.md#L121-L127),
[wrapper](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/src/MSALWrapper/MsalWrapper.cs#L35-L68).

Individual operations use separate timers. `TaskExecutor` may request cancellation and
return without proving the underlying operation stopped. Global timeout does not pass
cancellation into the active flow or join it before returning.
[task executor](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/src/MSALWrapper/TaskExecutor.cs#L27-L54),
[global executor](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/src/MSALWrapper/AuthFlow/AuthFlowExecutor.cs#L92-L144).

The mutex may therefore be released without source proof that prior controlled work has
terminated. SIGINT bypasses cooperative cancellation and calls `Environment.Exit(2)`.

**Disposition:** Retain `V2-REQ-015`, `V2-REQ-025`, and timeout and cancellation
categories in `V2-REQ-032`. The named-lock concept is architecture evidence only.

`V2-REQ-026` is now a retirement marker targeting `V2-REQ-041`. Shared-state locking and
update integrity remain required, while suppressing duplicate interaction across
separate CLI processes is not a product commitment.

### Host and mechanism ownership

**Evidence type:** Explicit public promise and source finding.
**Confidence:** 10/10 for source construction; no real-host result is inferred.

Windows broker derives a parent handle from the process console and root owner without
accepting caller-provided host context or rejecting a zero handle. macOS broker uses a
fixed redirect, Company Portal gate, and main-thread scheduler. Linux browser acquisition
invokes `$BROWSER` when set and otherwise delegates URI opening through shell execution.
Device code writes the provider message through the warning channel. IWA supplies
neither a strict account nor returned-identity check.
[Windows broker](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/src/MSALWrapper/AuthFlow/Broker.cs#L193-L244),
[Linux browser launcher](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/src/MSALWrapper/PCAWrapper.cs#L189-L207),
[device code](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/src/MSALWrapper/AuthFlow/DeviceCode.cs#L51-L102).

No distinct WSL host model appears in the fixed source.

**Disposition:** Retain `V2-REQ-016`, `V2-REQ-021`, `V2-REQ-022`, `V2-REQ-025`, and
`V2-REQ-032`. Mechanism call patterns are architecture inputs, not support evidence.
Support claims remain governed by the
[Real Environment Tests](../validation/strategy.md#real-environment-tests).

`V2-REQ-016` owns self-contained interactive surfaces and completion channels without
caller-provided UI ownership or raw handles. Unavailable paths cannot initiate unmanaged
interaction. This selects no concrete host implementation.

## Result and process findings

### Authoritative result metadata is discarded

**Evidence type:** Source finding and known defect.
**Confidence:** 10/10.

`PCAWrapper` receives an MSAL `AuthenticationResult` but retains only the access token
and correlation ID. Provider account, home-account identifier, tenant, authority, granted
scopes, token type, client, and other acquisition metadata are discarded.
[result reduction](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/src/MSALWrapper/PCAWrapper.cs#L209-L217).

`TokenResult` parses the access token as a JWT and derives user, display name, SID, and
expiry from token claims.
[token result](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/src/MSALWrapper/TokenResult.cs#L12-L77).

**Disposition:** Retain `V2-REQ-022`, `V2-REQ-030`, `V2-REQ-031`, and `V2-REQ-033`.
Provider-authoritative metadata is needed for validation, but `V2-REQ-031` limits public
account identity to the observed email. Stable provider IDs are not public success
metadata. Access tokens remain opaque; expiration is not a minimum-validity promise.

### `RECHECK-002`: strict account and result validation

**Evidence type:** Current public source, fixed source, bounded inference, and public
reported observation.
**Confidence:** 10/10 for the source contract and no-change disposition.

At the 2026-09-04 recheck,
[upstream issue #465](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/issues/465)
remained open and unanswered. It reports that AzureAuth on Windows could silently return
the operating-system account despite a different preferred domain. That real-host
behavior is a reporter observation and was not independently reproduced.

The reuse decision does not depend on reproducing that observation. Fixed source
independently establishes advisory suffix filtering, ambiguity collapse, OS-account
widening, token-only success, and absence of an authoritative result postcondition.

**Disposition:** `RECHECK-002` is completed with no weakening. Retain:

- `V2-REQ-012` and `V2-REQ-017`;
- `V2-REQ-020`, `V2-REQ-022`, and `V2-REQ-023`;
- complete identity metadata under `V2-REQ-031`; and
- typed interaction-required, ambiguity, and identity-validation outcomes under
  `V2-REQ-032`.

Do not reuse V1 account resolution, OS-account fallback, token-derived identity, or
"nonempty token equals success" as V2 contract behavior. Mechanism-level MSAL calls may
be adapted only behind V2 account and result validation.

### JSON and status output are lossy

**Evidence type:** Source finding and known defect.
**Confidence:** 10/10.

AAD JSON contains only `user`, `display_name`, `token`, and string-form expiration. It
has no protocol version or typed status and omits tenant, authority, client, stable
provider account ID, scopes/resource, token type, mechanism, and silent/interactive
classification. It is created through manual interpolation without a JSON-escaping step
for claim-derived strings.
[serialization](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/src/MSALWrapper/TokenResult.cs#L88-L102).

The human status output always says the token cache is warm, even when source flow
selection does not establish a cache hit.
[status](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/src/MSALWrapper/TokenResult.cs#L79-L86).

**Disposition:** `V2-REQ-030`, `V2-REQ-031`, and `V2-REQ-034` own the single structured
success/failure result and authoritative metadata. V1 raw, JSON, and status modes are
not alternative native V2 outputs. Wire-schema selection remains later contract work.

### Failure and process status are collapsed

**Evidence type:** Source finding.
**Confidence:** 10/10 for handler values; exact ordinary process propagation remains
unresolved.

Invalid request, exhausted acquisition, null result, timeout, provider failure, cache
failure, and caught exception generally converge on handler value `1`. SIGINT directly
exits `2`.
[command handler](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/src/AzureAuth/Commands/CommandAad.cs#L314-L331),
[failure path](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/src/AzureAuth/Commands/CommandAad.cs#L384-L424),
[SIGINT](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/src/AzureAuth/Program.cs#L131-L137).

`MainInner` calls the Lasso host without returning or assigning its execution result. The
fixed repository therefore does not establish exact process status for handler returns,
parse failures, enum conversion, unknown options, or unhandled exceptions.
[host call](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/src/AzureAuth/Program.cs#L123-L138).

**Disposition:** Retain `V2-REQ-004`, `V2-REQ-030`, and `V2-REQ-032`. V1 numeric exits
and framework behavior are compatibility-only. Native V2 requires one terminal result
and binary success/failure exit semantics, with specific failure detail in the payload.
The concrete shared nonzero value is not inherited from V1.

### Output, diagnostics, and secret channels

**Evidence type:** Source finding and unresolved implementation limit.
**Confidence:** High for application call sites; lower for unavailable Lasso behavior.

Program comments and configuration intend token output on stdout and warnings or errors
on stderr, but private Lasso behavior controls parts of routing, formatting, buffering,
and persistence.
[program configuration](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/src/AzureAuth/Program.cs#L113-L121).

Device-code text is emitted through the warning channel. Telemetry and debug paths
collect request identifiers, cached usernames, correlation data, and recursively
serialized raw exception messages without an application-owned redaction guarantee.
[device-code path](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/src/MSALWrapper/AuthFlow/DeviceCode.cs#L52-L101),
[telemetry conversion](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/src/AzureAuth/AuthFlowResultExtensions.cs#L39-L64).

The source does not prove that a secret was emitted, but it does not provide the V2
containment guarantee.

**Disposition:** `V2-REQ-034`, `V2-REQ-035`, and `V2-REQ-036` distinguish structured
results, necessary authentication/UI channels, and diagnostics. Authentication secrets,
raw emails, and stable email-derived identifiers are not diagnostic or telemetry content.
Email in the explicit request and validated success is a deliberate contract boundary.

## Cache, state, and coordination findings

### Cross-platform cache promise and secure-store attempt

**Evidence type:** Explicit public promise and source finding.
**Confidence:** 10/10 for the promise and source setup; no persistence success is
inferred.

V1 claims token caching on Windows, macOS, and Ubuntu, including headless Linux. Source
configures MSAL Extensions persistence for platform secure stores, verifies persistence,
and then registers the cache.
[README](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/README.md#L14-L24),
[cache setup](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/src/MSALWrapper/PCACache.cs#L64-L84).

**Disposition:** Retain `V2-REQ-040` and `V2-REQ-045`. Real persistence and
cross-invocation support claims remain governed by the
[Real Environment Tests](../validation/strategy.md#real-environment-tests).

### Headless Linux silently falls back to plaintext

**Evidence type:** Source finding and known policy defect.
**Confidence:** 10/10.

After a persistence exception, headless Linux is inferred solely from missing `DISPLAY`
and `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`. V1 then creates or reuses an unprotected file under
`~/.azureauth` and registers it through `WithUnprotectedFile`. Permission-hardening
failure produces warnings but does not prevent use.
[fallback](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/src/MSALWrapper/PCACache.cs#L85-L155),
[permissions](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/src/MSALWrapper/LinuxHelper.cs#L40-L85).

**Disposition:** This motivates the no-plaintext product choice in `V2-REQ-040`; it does
not prove a V2 implementation. `V2-REQ-045` still gates headless repeated-reuse claims.
There is no first-version selectable plaintext or fallback mode.

### Cache-disabled and persistence-failure behavior is untyped

**Evidence type:** Source finding plus bounded inference.
**Confidence:** 9/10.

Any nonempty `OEAUTH_MSAL_DISABLE_CACHE` value skips cache registration. On some
non-headless persistence failures, source logs and records the exception but continues
without selecting another persistent mode. The bounded inference is that acquisition can
continue with only process-local MSAL state, while callers receive no storage-mode result.
[cache setup](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/src/MSALWrapper/PCACache.cs#L59-L105).

**Disposition:** `V2-REQ-040` owns the single secure-state product policy.
`V2-REQ-041` owns unusable-state-as-miss recovery and validated-token success with a
machine-readable persistence warning. `V2-REQ-032` has no standalone cache/integrity
status. The source does not demonstrate that acquisition and persistence failures can
be separated on any current V2 platform; see the [dated recheck](#recheck-006-secure-store-availability).

### Namespace and lifecycle semantics are incomplete

**Evidence type:** Source finding and unresolved dependency limit.
**Confidence:** 9/10.

Application-visible cache names are at most tenant-scoped and use upstream
`.IdentityService` and `.azureauth` namespaces. The application does not define a
complete contract for atomic update, corruption, logout, migration, or incompatible
versions. A Linux keyring attribute named `Version=1` is not an application-level
version dispatcher.
[configuration](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/src/MSALWrapper/PCACache.cs#L22-L56).

MSAL Extensions behavior absent from the fixed repository is not inferred.

**Disposition:** Retain `V2-REQ-041` and `V2-REQ-044`. Cache technology, serialization,
and dependency-specific locking remain architecture and validation concerns. V2 has no
V1 importer and must not read, modify, delete, take over, or otherwise own V1 cache or
configuration state.

### Cache clearing is not a transactional logout

**Evidence type:** Explicit public promise and source finding.
**Confidence:** 10/10.

`--clear` promises to clear the cache for the supplied AAD application. It constructs a
PCA, enumerates accounts, removes them one at a time, and logs each username. It does not
delete the containing store and does not run under the acquisition mutex.
[clear option](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/src/AzureAuth/Commands/CommandAad.cs#L176-L180),
[implementation](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/src/AzureAuth/Commands/CommandAad.cs#L366-L381).

V1 uninstall removes installation and PATH state but does not promise authentication-state
cleanup.

**Disposition:** `V2-REQ-041` excludes first-version Logout, Cache Clear, Force Refresh,
and Account List. V1 clearing syntax and lifecycle are not native V2 capabilities. The
[compatibility policy](../product/compatibility-and-migration.md#migration-rules)
provides no V1 importer: V2 must not read, modify, delete, migrate, take over, or own V1
configuration, aliases, account records, token caches, credentials, PATs, telemetry
configuration, or device identifiers.

## Telemetry and diagnostics findings

### Network telemetry promise and unavailable backend semantics

**Evidence type:** Explicit public promise, source finding, and unresolved implementation
limit.
**Confidence:** 8/10 overall; 10/10 for application configuration.

README says network telemetry is off unless an Application Insights ingestion token is
supplied through an environment variable or upstream Windows registry path.
[README](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/README.md#L96-L109).

Program always constructs Lasso telemetry. Without a configured token it selects a dummy
token and `StandardOut`; with a token it selects Application Insights and asynchronous
delivery.
[configuration](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/src/AzureAuth/Program.cs#L62-L121).

The fixed source does not contain Lasso transport, serialization, persistence, privacy,
flushing, or shutdown behavior. "Telemetry off" therefore supports only the documented
network-export statement; it does not establish absence of local output or delayed
completion.

**Disposition:** `V2-REQ-046` now requires optional telemetry, disables network export
unless explicitly configured, and prevents export or bounded-flush failure from changing
the authentication result, process status, retry, fallback, interaction, or finite
termination. `V2-REQ-035`, `V2-REQ-043`, and `V2-REQ-044` continue to govern secret
containment and independent identity. `V2-REQ-036` adds the email privacy boundary.
The existing OpenTelemetry direction remains an input to later architecture work; this
reconciliation does not select its implementation or backend.

### Collected telemetry and diagnostic fields

**Evidence type:** Source finding and security limitation.
**Confidence:** 10/10 for call-site collection.

Command telemetry records client, resource, tenant, prompt hint, and scopes. Per-flow
telemetry includes flow name, success, duration, recursively serialized exception
messages, correlation ID, token validity, and silent status. Debug paths include cached
usernames and provider exception messages.
[command telemetry](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/src/AzureAuth/Commands/CommandAad.cs#L314-L331),
[flow telemetry](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/src/AzureAuth/AuthFlowResultExtensions.cs#L39-L64).

**Disposition:** `V2-REQ-034`, `V2-REQ-035`, `V2-REQ-036`, `V2-REQ-043`, and
`V2-REQ-046` govern diagnostic separation, secret/email containment, independent identity,
and bounded optional telemetry. No diagnostic schema or backend is selected here.

### Upstream telemetry device identity

**Evidence type:** Source finding.
**Confidence:** 9/10.

`azureauth info` obtains and displays a Lasso telemetry device ID;
`reset-device-id` asks Lasso to delete it. Its storage, generation, collision, and
uninstall semantics are not visible in the fixed repository.
[info](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/src/AzureAuth/Commands/CommandInfo.cs#L17-L41),
[reset](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/src/AzureAuth/Commands/Info/CommandInfoResetDeviceID.cs#L13-L30).

**Disposition:** Drop the upstream identifier under `V2-REQ-043` and `V2-REQ-044`; never
import it. Any fork-owned telemetry identity must follow the accepted independent
operational-identity requirements.

## Azure DevOps consumer findings

### `ado token` mixes authentication and consumer policy

**Evidence type:** Source finding.
**Confidence:** 10/10.

`ado token` combines a built-in Azure DevOps profile with:

- PAT precedence from `AZUREAUTH_ADO_PAT` and `SYSTEM_ACCESSTOKEN`;
- pipeline detection through `TF_BUILD`;
- refusal of interactive fallback in selected pipeline conditions;
- fallback to delegated AAD acquisition; and
- raw token, header, and header-value formatting.

[command](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/src/AzureAuth/Commands/Ado/CommandToken.cs#L20-L145),
[PAT environment source](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/src/AzureAuth/Ado/PatFromEnv.cs#L36-L63).

PAT material from the environment is passed through a logging call. The unavailable
logging implementation prevents a stronger persistence claim, but this is at least a
secret-channel risk.

**Disposition:** Pipeline policy, PAT selection, and HTTP header formatting are
downstream consumer concerns outside the authentication core under `V2-REQ-002`. Secret
containment remains governed by `V2-REQ-035`.

### PAT creation and lifecycle

**Evidence type:** Explicit public promise, source finding, and known defect.
**Confidence:** 10/10.

`ado pat` validates organization, display name, scope, and prompt hint; enforces or
bypasses a static scope list; creates and caches PATs; and applies seven-day validity and
two-day renewal thresholds.
[usage](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/docs/usage.md#L142-L160),
[manager](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/src/AdoPat/PatManager.cs#L20-L88).

PAT output includes raw token, base64, header, header value, status, JSON, and `none`.
The `none` formatter returns an empty string, but the command still calls
`Console.WriteLine`, emitting a newline.

**Disposition:** PAT lifecycle is explicitly unsupported in the V2 authentication core
under `V2-REQ-002`. A separate PAT product would require its own accepted product,
security, lifecycle, support, and migration authorities. V1 output formats remain
compatibility-only.

## Installation, release, support, and operational-identity findings

### Upstream operational identities

**Evidence type:** Source finding.
**Confidence:** 10/10.

Upstream-visible identities include:

- executable `azureauth`;
- package `microsoft.authentication.azureauth`;
- Microsoft root namespaces;
- installation roots such as `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\AzureAuth`, `~/.azureauth`, and
  `/usr/bin/azureauth`;
- cache roots `.IdentityService` and `.azureauth`;
- upstream environment-variable prefixes;
- registry path `SOFTWARE\Microsoft\AzureAuth`;
- lock names; and
- telemetry namespace `azureauth`.

**Disposition:** These are compatibility facts, not reusable defaults. Retain
`V2-REQ-003`, `V2-REQ-043`, and `V2-REQ-044`, plus the
[side-by-side compatibility policy](../product/compatibility-and-migration.md#side-by-side-first).

### Installation and package surface

**Evidence type:** Explicit public promise and source finding.
**Confidence:** 10/10 for installer and release definitions; no installed behavior is
inferred.

V1 publishes exact-version installation paths for:

- Windows x64 and arm64 ZIP artifacts, with user-PATH updates by default;
- macOS x64 and arm64 tarballs, with shell-profile updates by default; and
- Linux x64 and arm64 Debian packages installed through `sudo dpkg -i`.

The release definition targets self-contained `net8.0` artifacts for all six
platform/architecture combinations.
[release matrix](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/.azuredevops/release.yml#L9-L47),
[artifact definitions](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/.azuredevops/release.yml#L355-L480).

Bootstrap scripts download release artifacts without an application-level checksum or
digest-verification step. That statement does not assess GitHub transport or external
signing.

**Disposition:** Installer behavior and artifact names are compatibility-only. Packaging
knowledge is an architecture input. `V2-REQ-044` requires independent operational
identity, and platform support remains governed by the
[Real Environment Tests](../validation/strategy.md#real-environment-tests).

### Public build dependency boundary

**Evidence type:** Source finding.
**Confidence:** 10/10.

The audited `nuget.config` clears package sources and selects a credentialed Office Azure
Artifacts feed. `AzureAuth.csproj` directly references `Microsoft.Office.Lasso`.
[NuGet configuration](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/nuget.config),
[project](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/src/AzureAuth/AzureAuth.csproj#L28-L35).

This is a source finding only. It does not repeat or extend any runtime build
observation.

**Disposition:** Retain `V2-REQ-053`. V2 restore, build, test, and packaging must use
publicly retrievable dependencies and fork-owned infrastructure. Hosting, environment
access, logging, diagnostics, and telemetry responsibilities currently associated with
Lasso require removal, replacement, or isolation through a separately selected
architecture.

### Release-documentation inconsistencies

**Evidence type:** Known defect/workaround.
**Confidence:** 10/10.

At tag `0.9.5`, the README badge still advertises `0.9.2`. At tag `0.9.6`, the README
and installation examples still identify `0.9.5`, while the changelog places the macOS
broker and dependency changes under "Unreleased."
[0.9.5 README](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/21258ff3a2cbb01d6891243114a55abe9ae3587e/README.md#L1-L5),
[0.9.6 README](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/8ef1b8b00782bf20a51de078289819a79c3cba70/README.md#L1-L5),
[0.9.6 changelog](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/8ef1b8b00782bf20a51de078289819a79c3cba70/CHANGELOG.md#L7-L20).

**Disposition:** Bind compatibility evidence to exact tag commits rather than badges or
changelog section names.

### Upstream support statement

**Evidence type:** Explicit public promise.
**Confidence:** 10/10.

V1 directs support through the Microsoft-owned upstream repository.
[support policy](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918/SUPPORT.md#L3-L13).

**Disposition:** This is historical V1 context only. `V2-REQ-003` prohibits implying an
official Microsoft release, upstream support, or ownership of a Microsoft registration.

## Fixed-version deltas

### `0.9.5` to `0.9.6`

The material caller-visible change is opt-in macOS Enterprise SSO broker integration.
Non-Windows `AuthMode` gains broker; source adds Company Portal/version checks and
main-thread scheduling; and MSAL and native-interoperability dependencies change.
[Fixed comparison](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/compare/21258ff3a2cbb01d6891243114a55abe9ae3587e...8ef1b8b00782bf20a51de078289819a79c3cba70).

This is an explicit documentation and source delta. It does not establish real macOS
broker availability, MDM behavior, account selection, cancellation, or support.

### `0.9.6` to the audited baseline

Only project dependency declarations materially changed: cryptography packages were
updated and `OpenTelemetry.Api` was added. No command, option, output, installer, README,
usage, or release-definition source changed.
[Fixed comparison](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/compare/8ef1b8b00782bf20a51de078289819a79c3cba70...de20930c34b3b86c8a0ed7bbdeeca3f662dae918).

No runtime equivalence or telemetry-backend conclusion follows from that source-only
delta. OpenTelemetry remains a later architecture choice.

## Fired recheck dispositions

### `RECHECK-001`: silent-only acquisition

**Required outcome:** Determine whether upstream now exposes a documented no-interaction
acquisition contract and whether that changes the V2 interaction-policy requirements.

**Current-source finding:** At the evaluation time,
[issue #464](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/issues/464)
remained an open, unanswered request. It asks for interaction permission independent of
authentication mode and states that the reporter could not identify an existing
supported invocation. The named source contains no maintainer response, documentation
pointer, resolution, or implementation reference.

**Bounded inference:** Within the authorized source set, upstream does not expose a
documented no-interaction contract that preserves silent-capable mechanisms while
guaranteeing no UI. This does not claim that every mutable upstream file outside the
authorized source set was searched.

**Outcome:** Completed with no requirements weakening. Retain `V2-REQ-014`,
`V2-REQ-013`, `V2-REQ-020`, `V2-REQ-021`, `V2-REQ-023`, and the interaction-required
outcome under `V2-REQ-032`. Replace V1 global interaction filtering and combined broker
orchestration. This remains the 2026-09-04 source outcome, not a fresh source-status claim.

### `RECHECK-002`: strict account selection

**Required outcome:** Determine whether upstream now provides strict account selection
and result-identity validation that changes the V2 account contract or reuse decision.

**Current-source finding:** At the evaluation time,
[issue #465](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/issues/465)
remained open and unanswered. Its Windows/WAM behavior is a public reporter observation
rather than a newly reproduced result.

**Bounded inference:** Fixed source independently establishes a non-strict contract:
suffix-based preference, absence/ambiguity collapse, OS-account widening, token-derived
identity, and no authoritative returned-identity postcondition. The reuse decision
therefore does not depend on treating the reporter's real-host observation as
independently reproduced.

**Outcome:** Completed with no requirements weakening. Retain `V2-REQ-012`,
`V2-REQ-017`, `V2-REQ-020`, `V2-REQ-022`, `V2-REQ-023`, `V2-REQ-031`, and the
applicable `V2-REQ-032` failure categories. Do not reuse V1 account resolution or result
handling as V2 policy.

### `RECHECK-006`: secure-store availability

**Required outcome:** Record current secure-store behavior and unresolved platform
limitations before accepting cache fallback or declaring a platform supported.

**Provenance:** Desk retrieval on **2026-09-09 UTC**, under accepted Wave
`1a02498589769c38bc16eefc2efc5f9eca6e6994`, was limited to
[issue #398](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/issues/398), its
[public Issue API](https://api.github.com/repos/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/issues/398),
and its
[public comments API](https://api.github.com/repos/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/issues/398/comments).
At retrieval, the Issue was open, had zero comments, and reported
`updated_at = 2024-08-13T16:18:59Z`; the first comments page was empty.
The [desk outcome](https://github.com/hcoona/microsoft-authentication-cli/issues/29#issuecomment-5595449718)
and [independent review](https://github.com/hcoona/microsoft-authentication-cli/issues/29#issuecomment-5595466517)
retain the prerequisite disposition and actual merged-Wave evaluation.

**Evidence type:** Publicly reported observation, not an independently reproduced runtime
result. The reporter describes AzureAuth **0.8.6.0**, installed from a Debian package on
a headless Ubuntu VM, failing during an Azure DevOps PAT invocation. The report describes
persistence-verification failures followed by a keyring-read failure associated with an
unavailable `org.freedesktop.secrets` service. Device-code interaction appears in the
report but does not establish successful token acquisition or reusable-state persistence.
The Issue/comments contain no maintainer resolution or documented supported nonpersistent
path. Raw diagnostics, authentication instructions, codes, and account or organization
details are not reproduced here.

**Bounded conclusion:** The desk prerequisite is satisfied, not a platform-support gate.
This report does not establish current-release behavior, all-headless-Linux behavior,
Windows/WAM or macOS behavior, or V2's ability to separate acquisition from persistence
failure. The pinned [plaintext fallback](#headless-linux-silently-falls-back-to-plaintext)
and [process-local continuation](#cache-disabled-and-persistence-failure-behavior-is-untyped)
findings remain source findings for their audited commit. The
[architecture audit's #398 reference](v1-architecture-audit.md#finding-6-cache-policy-contains-an-implicit-security-decision)
remains only a reported example, not a current fix or support guarantee.

**Disposition:** The no-plaintext choice (`V2-REQ-040`), unusable-state recovery and
success-with-persistence-warning behavior (`V2-REQ-041`) are product decisions, not facts
demonstrated by #398. Secure-store availability, error separation, concurrent state
integrity, and cross-invocation reuse require later implementation and platform evidence
under the [validation strategy](../validation/strategy.md). No experiment is authorized
by this result.

### Issue #29 reconciliation trigger evaluation

The requirements reconciliation continues the `interaction-policy`, `account-contract`,
and `cache-design` decision concerns. Their recheck controls therefore apply even though
this change performs no experiment or release:

- `RECHECK-001` and `RECHECK-002`: the accepted 2026-09-04 outcomes and fixed-source reuse
  conclusions remain unchanged. The primary-story wording does not rely on a new
  upstream feature or refresh those mutable status claims. Their current requirement
  dispositions are updated above.
- `RECHECK-006`: the 2026-09-09 source-only outcome and independent disposition satisfy
  the desk prerequisite for this reconciliation, with implementation/support still gated.
- `RECHECK-003`, `RECHECK-004`, and `RECHECK-005`: no WSL, system-browser, or Linux-broker
  workstream is selected; these triggers are not activated by this change.
- `RECHECK-007`: no profile is selected or enabled. The existing empirical prerequisite
  remains outstanding; the first-release journey does not satisfy it.

The actual #31 merged-Wave fallback evaluated all seven entries in the independent
review linked above. This proposal does not change the Wave. Any later merged-Wave,
release, or newly fired source-relevant trigger still requires its applicable review.

### Architecture Boundary Recheck Assessment

The high-level architecture allocation under Issue #35 continues the interaction,
account, and cache decision concerns. A desk refresh on **2026-09-09 UTC** inspected the
named public sources for RECHECK-001, RECHECK-002, and RECHECK-006:

| Entry and source | Retrieved public state | Bounded decision impact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RECHECK-001: [Issue #464](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/issues/464) | Open, zero comments; `updated_at = 2026-08-17T21:12:04Z`. The Issue API and first comments page were read; the comments page was empty. | The named source remains an unanswered interaction-policy request, not a documented upstream no-interaction contract. Preserve separate engine policy and provider operations. |
| RECHECK-002: [Issue #465](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/issues/465) | Open, zero comments; the public page's embedded issue metadata reports `updatedAt = 2026-08-27T22:02:13Z`. | No new resolution in this carrier changes the fixed-source strict-selection findings. Preserve real-account resolution and final authoritative result validation. |
| RECHECK-006: [Issue #398](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/issues/398) | Open, zero comments; the public page's embedded issue metadata reports `updatedAt = 2024-08-13T16:18:59Z`. | The accepted bounded report remains unresolved. It does not demonstrate current dependency behavior or select a store, plaintext fallback, or supported platform. |

Authenticated upstream API retrieval was unavailable because of organization SAML
enforcement. Anonymous Issue #464 API retrieval succeeded; subsequent anonymous API
retrieval hit a rate limit, so the refresh used the public HTML pages for #465 and #398.
The latter snapshots establish the Issue state and comment count, not a new runtime
observation or a fresh audit of upstream implementations. Raw #398 diagnostics were not
retained. The earlier source findings and their limitations remain authoritative for
their recorded versions.

For this architecture boundary allocation, the three desk outcomes preserve the accepted
requirements and source-reuse dispositions. They do not establish that a particular
provider exposes the needed account metadata, persistence separation, or no-UI behavior.
Those decision-critical premises remain open in the
[architecture](../architecture/overview.md#decision-critical-open-questions).

RECHECK-003, RECHECK-004, and RECHECK-005 do not fire: no WSL, system-browser, or
Linux-broker workstream is selected by the mechanism-neutral views. RECHECK-007's
account-type prerequisite remains unresolved; no profile is selected or enabled, and
its dated public-guidance finding below is not refreshed by these Issue snapshots. There
is no release or Wave change. Later selections and fired triggers still require their
applicable outcomes and independent evidence review.

### `RECHECK-007`: Azure DevOps Microsoft-account behavior

**Required outcome:** Record current public guidance and reproducible account-type
behavior before selecting or enabling an Azure DevOps compatibility client profile.

**Current-source finding:** Microsoft Learn currently states that Microsoft Entra
applications do not natively support Microsoft-account users for the Azure DevOps
resource, recommends Azure DevOps OAuth apps for applications requiring MSA or mixed
users, and says Microsoft is working on native MSA support through Entra OAuth. It
identifies Azure DevOps resource `499b84ac-1321-427f-aa17-267ca6975798` and recommends
its `.default` scope.
[Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/integrate/get-started/authentication/entra-oauth?view=azure-devops#tips-for-building-and-migrating).

Fixed AzureAuth source proves that V1 submits the Microsoft-owned Visual Studio client ID
and Azure DevOps scope. It does not establish successful MSA behavior, owner-approved
third-party reuse, supported authority or host combinations, or continued registration
availability. The mock `live.com` account in unit tests establishes suffix-filter logic
only.

**Bounded inference:** The Learn statement describes ordinary Entra applications and
does not establish the behavior or intended reuse boundary of this particular
Microsoft-owned registration. Conversely, the ability to submit the client ID is not
evidence of MSA support or intended reuse.

**Outcome:** Desk evaluation completed, but the substantive selection prerequisite
remains unresolved because reproducible account-type behavior evidence is absent.

Do not:

- add an MSA-support promise;
- select, enable, default, or distribute the Microsoft-owned profile;
- treat it as an available built-in or sole candidate; or
- classify the registration as supported or categorically unsupported for MSA.

Retain `V2-REQ-003`, `V2-REQ-011`, `V2-REQ-018`, `V2-REQ-022`, `V2-REQ-023`,
`V2-REQ-042`, and the
[external-client-profile gate](../product/compatibility-and-migration.md#externally-owned-client-profile-gate).
Generic profile-selection semantics apply independently, but this candidate remains
unavailable until the gate is satisfied.

## Windows MSAL Probe Basis

The [bounded Windows protocol](experiments/windows-msal-account-metadata.md) narrows the
next empirical step to account discovery, selected-account acquisition, authoritative
metadata, and subsequent broker reuse. It uses V1's managed/native dependency versions
in a small research probe rather than V1's token-printing CLI. It does not execute the
previously proposed two-account resource comparison or establish resource authorization.

The protocol's [execution history](experiments/windows-msal-account-metadata.md#execution-history)
records the first preparation's public-index failure. No MSAL runtime observation
resulted. The amended preparation transfers pinned public packages through WSL to a
Windows local feed; it does not change the native Windows account or token boundary.

**Pinned source findings, reviewed on 2026-09-10 UTC:** MSAL 4.83.1's
[`BrokerOptions`](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/blob/d5d7de6b103f0d9dd7bca9bf13cbb9f3da37bc9f/src/client/Microsoft.Identity.Client/ApiConfig/BrokerOptions.cs#L81-L87)
exposes `ListOperatingSystemAccounts`. The
[`runtime broker`](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/blob/d5d7de6b103f0d9dd7bca9bf13cbb9f3da37bc9f/src/client/Microsoft.Identity.Client.Broker/RuntimeBroker.cs#L571-L632)
returns an empty list when this option is off and otherwise calls discovery, filters the
cloud environment, and converts the returned accounts. V1 0.9.6's
[`Windows broker configuration`](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/blob/8ef1b8b00782bf20a51de078289819a79c3cba70/src/MSALWrapper/AuthFlow/Broker.cs#L232-L242)
does not enable that option. This is an available dependency capability, not evidence
that a particular existing personal account will be visible or have an exact email.

MSAL's
[`broker availability query`](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/blob/d5d7de6b103f0d9dd7bca9bf13cbb9f3da37bc9f/src/client/Microsoft.Identity.Client/PublicClientApplication.cs#L80-L98)
and
[`custom web UI callback`](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/blob/d5d7de6b103f0d9dd7bca9bf13cbb9f3da37bc9f/src/client/Microsoft.Identity.Client/Extensibility/ICustomWebUI.cs#L30-L52)
let the probe require WAM and decline browser fallback. The callback implements no OAuth
exchange. The hidden first-party `MsaPassthrough` option remains off, as in V1's Windows
configuration. No MSAL dependency is upgraded by this experiment input.

### Host and Registration Recheck for the Probe

The 2026-09-10 UTC desk refresh inspected the public sources below before proposing
native Windows execution initiated from WSL. This evaluates the applicable research
boundary; it selects no V2 WSL or Linux-broker implementation and transports no token.

| Concern and source | Retrieved state and bounded outcome |
| --- | --- |
| Windows [WAM guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/msal/dotnet/acquiring-tokens/desktop-mobile/wam) | The page identifies supported Windows versions, a required parent window, account picking for mixed authority audiences, and possible browser fallback. The probe owns a Windows Forms parent, requires broker availability, and declines browser fallback. These are preparation choices, not observed host behavior. |
| RECHECK-003: [Issue #460](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/issues/460) | Open; `updated_at = 2026-05-13T17:25:51Z`. Its body proposes a Windows helper, trust/version/transport boundaries, and missing-helper/fallback handling. It is a proposal, not evidence of an upstream implemented bridge. This probe uses an exact local Windows executable and returns only flags. |
| RECHECK-003/005: [current WSL guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/msal/dotnet/acquiring-tokens/desktop-mobile/linux-dotnet-sdk-wsl) | Documents native Linux broker packages, dependencies, and an unlocked keychain. It does not supply the Windows-helper protocol proposed by #460. This experiment uses native Windows WAM; it does not install or invoke that Linux broker. |
| RECHECK-005: [PR #462](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-cli/pull/462) | Open and unmerged; `updated_at = 2026-08-14T10:00:41Z`. The inspected diff adds Linux broker routing, a Linux redirect, and OS-account listing, while retaining an OS-default sentinel fallback. Its reported Ubuntu test is public author-reported experience, not a V2 support result or this experiment's implementation. |
| RECHECK-007: [Azure DevOps guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/integrate/get-started/authentication/entra-oauth?view=azure-devops) | Still states that ordinary Entra applications do not natively support MSA users for the Azure DevOps resource. The specific Microsoft-owned registration's behavior and intended reuse remain unresolved; this protocol observes acquisition/metadata only. |

RECHECK-001, RECHECK-002, and RECHECK-006 retain their bounded desk dispositions; this
protocol does not amend product interaction, account, or cache requirements. RECHECK-004
is not activated as a browser workstream: the probe declines that mechanism. Later
platform/Profile choices and fired triggers retain their full recorded outcomes.

## Contradictions and unsupported conclusions

The following conflicts and evidence limits are retained rather than silently resolved:

1. Usage says resource is required, while source permits explicit scopes without
   resource.
2. Windows usage labels web acquisition as an embedded view, while fixed source requests
   a non-embedded/system-browser path.
3. The changelog describes `--timeout` as an allowed-runtime contract, while lock waiting
   occurs outside that timeout and active-work termination is not proved.
4. V1's noninteractive wording implies interaction suppression, while source does not
   structurally separate silent and interactive broker stages.
5. Status output claims the token cache is warm regardless of the successful acquisition
   path.
6. AAD JSON is documented as machine output but is manually interpolated, incomplete,
   and not guaranteed to escape arbitrary claim-derived text.
7. Source intends stdout and stderr separation, but unavailable Lasso behavior prevents
   an exact V1 stream and process-exit contract.
8. "Telemetry off" is supportable only as the documented network-export statement;
   default local output, persistence, flushing, and shutdown behavior remain unknown.
9. Platform, mechanism, cache, installer, and package statements are public V1 promises
   or source definitions, not runtime evidence or inherited V2 support.
10. Release tags, README badges, installation examples, and changelog headings disagree;
    exact commits govern this baseline.
11. Issue #465's Windows/WAM account behavior is a public reported observation, not an
    independently reproduced result. Static source is sufficient to establish that the
    contract is non-strict.
12. Current general Azure DevOps guidance does not establish the behavior or reuse
    boundary of the particular Microsoft-owned Visual Studio registration used by V1.
13. The private feed and Lasso dependency are static build-input findings. This record
    makes no new restore, build, test, or packaging result claim.
14. `OpenTelemetry.Api` appearing in the project file does not establish a telemetry
    backend, export contract, or equivalence with Lasso.

## Bounded conclusion

AzureAuth V1 is useful evidence for mechanism integration, caller-visible promises,
failure modes, cache-policy defects, and packaging knowledge. It is not a sufficient
deterministic machine authentication contract or a V2 platform-support baseline.

The per-surface dispositions above map these findings to the
[canonical V2 requirements](../product/requirements/), while the
[compatibility policy](../product/compatibility-and-migration.md) and
[validation strategy](../validation/strategy.md) own their respective decisions and
obligations. Those records, rather than this evidence record, define current product
behavior, compatibility, and support-claim validation.

V1 commands, option names, aliases, environment variables, output forms, numeric exits,
installation paths, and upstream identities remain compatibility-only. Azure DevOps PAT
behavior and downstream HTTP formatting remain outside the authentication core.
Mechanism and platform source may inform later architecture, but does not establish
support.

`RECHECK-001` and `RECHECK-002` are complete and support no weakening of the interaction
or account contracts. `RECHECK-007` has completed its desk evaluation, but the
Microsoft-owned Azure DevOps profile remains unresolved and unselected pending separately
authorized evidence for the single retained empirical question.
